                    <p>Imprezzio Marketing's product sales, supervisors and support team had to rely on multiple tools to review client accounts that required repetitive data entry into the respective applications, leading to increased opportunity for data entry error and wasted time on duplicate entry work. </p>

                    <h4>Project requirements</h4>
                    <p>They had no tool to keep track of the various products for different clients and to monitor the tasks that they had to carry out on a regular basis. As a result, Imprezzio Marketing experienced serious difficulties with obtaining visibility into their day-to-day business operations and gaining insights into how their marketing services could be improved and optimized.

                    <p>By using the AdTools solution, Imprezzio Marketing was able to organize their activities way better. They are now able to keep track of all their activities, even with a team twice as big as they had before. The operational costs of the company decreased significantly and their efficiency exploded, which is partly due to the fact that they now have a tool to keep track of every activity, generate clear reports, assign work, analyze employee performance and monitor everything better. Overall, the tool made it possible for them to organize themselves better. They were satisfied with the product, and the results of using it are clearly visible. They are more organized and they have a very clear understanding about the tasks they perform. They are able to manage their specialized teams (adwords, directories, maps) and managers have a clear overview about each employee's performance.</p>
