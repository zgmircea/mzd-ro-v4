            <h3>GR-EAT</h3>
            <p><em>Guidelines for Recognition: European Advanced Tool</em></p>
            <p><strong>GR-EAT</strong> is a youth project aiming at enhancing the recognition of Non Formal and Informal Learning and at providing youth-led organisations with support and guidance to implement internal systems of recognition of the competences of their volunteers.</p>
            <p>They needed to put a face to the message and program they were trying to spread so I created a brand identity for them.</p>

            <p>The first step was to identify the brand values: <strong>Growth, Change, Transformation, Energy, Wisdom</strong>.</p>
            <p>I always do my logos in black & white. It's something I learnt a while back from a mentor I had. It forces you to focus on the symbolism and message and does not steal attention from function.</p>
            <p>I started by brainstorming and mind-mapping all the things I could come up with regarding the project. There were multiple ideas on the table and I decided to visualise some of those so I could quickly include the client in the process.</p>

            <h4 class="white">The first batch</h4>
            <p>These were the first quick "sketches" I made to test the multiple direction available. The client was putting them under focus group review and I wanted to know they were envisioning for the brand and get their creative juices going.</p>

            <p>Since the symbol is pretty complex I figured a clean logotype will do the trick. Smart but simple. </p>
