            <p>LUNA is a period tracking app for women that learns and adapts to its user.</p>

            <h4>What is the app trying to solve?</h4>
            <ul>
                <li> - provide an easy alternative to period tracking</li>
                <li> - give notifications before the period</li>
                <li> - help schedule a vacation</li>
                <li> - have an overview when going to the doctor</li>
                <li> - reminder for birth control pills</li>
                <li> - keep track of fertility and help make babies</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>I established which are the particular and general outcomes of the application and understood the main needs and circumstances under which the application might be used.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>- personal assumptions of the targets and potential</li>
                <li>- web research on some of the user's behaviour</li>
                <li>- talk to real users of different levels of budgets, believes, ages, jobs and education</li>
                <li>- brainstorming</li>
            </ol>

            <blockquote>“For me, it would be useful to be notified when my period is approaching. You know, you have to get stuff with you to work and sometimes I forget. It would like it to be easy to keep track and not always go back and forth on that ugly calendar and add my period months back because I forgot. Ohh and it would be nice to have an idea when planning a vacation so that I avoid awkward situations.“ </blockquote>

            <p> <strong>LUNA</strong> was designed for windows mobile but unfortunately, since Microsoft dropped its windows phone support the app will be moved to Android and iOS. Initial user testing showed great potential and I can hardly wait to see it out in the wild.</p>
