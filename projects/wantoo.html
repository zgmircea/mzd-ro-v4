            <p>We brainstormed and trew ideas at each other to see what's the best way to approach  this subject. We wanted something easy because it would decently not be something new.</p>
            <p>We settled on the idea that the user would to be able to ask the phone to help out when he's not in the mood to do a complicated search.            
                It was about keeping the interaction as simple as possible and be very quick. So that ultimately meant no login, one screen(well two) and 3 easy steps. Just select your action, option and pick your choice. That's it.</p>
             <p>I started to sketch some simple flows and wireframes.</p>
