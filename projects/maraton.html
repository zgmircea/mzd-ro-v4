            <h3>maraton Mobile</h3>
            <em>Free mobile broadband wit a little bit of advertising</em>
            <p>maraton Communications Ltd. was founded in September 2009 and is one of the first companies in the world to offer advertiser-funded mobile broadband (3G internet) to customers, free of charge. As such, the company needed to combine web, telecoms and advertising technologies into a single proposition, resulting in a significant process of Research & Development to prove the concept, building the product and integrating the various partners, suppliers and platforms. maraton launched nationwide in the UK in May 2012.</p>

            <h4>”Just perfect simple, Just smart”</h4>
            <p>The value proposition was simple: users watched online ads and would get internet traffic (MB) for their phone/tablet for free.</p>
            <P class="memo">*In collaboration with <a href="http://www.borndesign.com.au/" rel="nofollow">Chris Hardborne</a> as Art Director.</P>

        <div class="col span_6 pushone">
            <p>Together with the product owners and the art director we established goals and created strategies that led us to clear user flows.</p>
            <p><em>We started with the “User-Select-Model”, which maraton suggested with the purpose of generating higher conversion rates.</em></p>
            <p>I created flows and wireframes to get things started and worked together with the product owner and art director to create a holistic experience centered around the user. The strategy went through a lot of focus groups on the client side and the mockups through a lot of user testing until we moved forward to the prototypes and UI development. The interface needed to be responsive as users would use it mostly on a device.</p>

            <h4 class="white">Evolution in revolution</h4>
            <p>The flows were preety straight formward so what we had to really nail down was the interaction. I did a lot of wireframes. We had focus groups and discussed a lot on why, how and where things shoud be on the screens. We planned each step of the user's journey. We did a lot of variations on the IA and focused on minimalism.</p>
            <p>For the landing page the main goal was the signup. We decided to let users earn credit and then funnel their signup. This would allow the users to see how easy it is to earn credit and would also create scarcity of loosing the earned credit and would increase the chances of signing up.</p>

            <p> It's just about making it better. More discussions on the landing page, more research, a lot more iterations and finnaly a brand new home page.</p>
            <p>The home page was rebuilt around the community and talk maraton was generating to reinforce trust, create associations and reassure new users about the service.</p>

            <p><strong>maraton</strong> became an absolute hit. The business started to grow rapidly and most importantly, users love maraton because they are in charge. They earn as much or as little data as they want.</p>
            <p>The maraton video engagement network is an aggregation of discrete innovations, which come together to make an advertising video distribution hyper-network – to the best of our knowledge the first in the world, and therefore unique. Imprezzio and maraton continue to grow the business together, using the same form of cooperation.</p>
