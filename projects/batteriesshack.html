            <p>Altough they are a relatively small business they concentrate on great quality products and a great customer service. They work with big american brands and support local business.</p>
            <p>A modern Ui design that would focus on reinforcing their identity and inspire confidence. Unclutter the Ui and make everything easy to find by category of product. Focus on contact methods & information. Build trust using client feedback.</p>

        <p>I decided to keep the category bar on the home page as it was intuitive and provided a quick access to the main content. Reccuring users were acustomed to it. It is uncluttered and more readable.</p>
