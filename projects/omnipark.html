            <p>Helping define such a complex solution to cater to a vast variety of needs was a true and ongoing challange. It requires a holistic approach on each interaction as the experiences need to be thought individually but also as part of a bigger system.</p>
            <p>A long analisys of the existing system was required, pain points needed to be identified and step by step each module needed to be broken down and enhanced.</p>
            <p>We started by brokeing down the systme into 8 core products and experiences: Central Management System, Event Parking, OmniPayPoint, CallToPark Pay by Phone, Handheld Enforcement, Integrated Payment Options, PermitPoint, PayMyNotice.</p>
            <p>We analysed existimg systems, defined the needs of the users and defined the journeys as stories.</p>

            <p>The interface of the PayPoint device was confusing and needed to be overhauled. We talked to some users and idetified some discrepancies between the visual and logical hierachy.</p>

            <p>I created wireframes, made sketches, mockups  and prototypes to deliver the new UI. After user testing and some iterations we had a stable version. We monitored closely how users interact with our software and made sure to offer new features and cater to their needs.</p>
            <p><em>The challenge was to keep the balance between the old UI and the new one so that existing users wouldn't feel frustrated learning it</em>.</p>

            <p>The first thing we had to sort out was how to present our product to the world. <strong>Netective</strong> was known as <strong>NetMinder</strong> and had no identity as a product. A new name was found and so I started work on the new visual identity. We decided to keep some parts of the old logo style so there would still be a bridge from the old to the new.</p>
